# Backend Data Storage

## Current Status: ✅ Hybrid Mode - Local + Cloud Sync

The app runs in **hybrid mode** with both local storage and Blue.cc cloud sync fully operational.

## Database File

`tasks.json` - This file contains your project data and is **not tracked by git** to preserve your work data during development.

### Initial Setup

If you're setting up the project for the first time:

1. Copy the template file:
   ```bash
   cp backend/tasks.json.template backend/tasks.json
   ```

2. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Important Notes

- **tasks.json is gitignored** - Your local data will never be committed to the repository
- This prevents accidental data loss during development
- Each developer/environment maintains their own data

## Blue.cc Integration Status

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Blue.cc Account Structure

**CRITICAL INFORMATION**:
- Blue.cc only allows **ONE company per account**
- Your company is: **Inner Allies Academy**
- Organization URL: https://blue.cc/org/inner-allies-academy
- Organization ID: `clzwnz89g20hbx92uay4mzglv`

**DO NOT**:
- Try to create additional companies (not permitted)
- Use any other company IDs in the code
- Delete the "Inner Allies Academy" organization

**If you see other companies**: These will be removed by Blue.cc support. Only use Inner Allies Academy.

### Current Integration Status

**Last Updated**: 2026-01-20
**Status**: Reconfiguring after workspace cleanup

#### Blue.cc Workspace Configuration
- ✅ Company: "Inner Allies Academy"
  - URL: https://blue.cc/org/inner-allies-academy
  - ID: `clzwnz89g20hbx92uay4mzglv`
  - UID: `b7601c606ec54c68918034b06fac01bb`
- ✅ Project: "PMT" (Correct project name!)
  - ID: `cmklpzm7k152gp71ee0lm6bwa`
  - UID: `e6af414f10734aff84fe8445c3aecb53`
- ✅ TodoList: Tasks (cmklqbb0z13yjnd1e4pjokze9)
  - Status: Empty and ready for production data

#### Test Results
Run the integration test suite:
```bash
cd backend
node test-bluecc-integration.js
```

**Expected Output**:
```
✅ Test 1: API connection - PASSED
✅ Test 2: Create task with metadata - PASSED
✅ Test 3: Read task from cloud - PASSED
✅ Test 4: Update task - PASSED
✅ Test 5: Delete test task - PASSED

All 5 tests passed! Blue.cc integration is working correctly.
```

#### How It Works
The application uses a **hybrid approach**:
1. **Local Cache** (tasks.json): Fast access, offline support
2. **Cloud Sync** (Blue.cc API): Automatic backup, multi-device sync

All CRUD operations automatically sync to Blue.cc while maintaining a local copy for performance and offline resilience.

### Data Structure

The tasks.json file follows this structure:
```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Task title",
      "description": "Task description",
      "tags": ["dimension", "element"],
      "status": "To do",
      "dueDate": "2026-01-20",
      "workType": "part-of-element",
      "activities": [],
      "resources": {}
    }
  ],
  "nextId": 2
}
```
