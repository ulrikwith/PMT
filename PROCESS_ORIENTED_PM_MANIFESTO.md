# Process-Oriented Project Management
## A New Category for a Different Way of Working

---

## Executive Summary

**Process-Oriented Project Management (POPM)** is a fundamentally different approach to managing creative, meaningful work. Unlike traditional task-based systems built for structuralists, POPM recognizes that millions of people—creators, artists, educators, healers, and consciousness workers—think in **contexts, flows, and meaning-containers**, not linear task sequences.

This document defines POPM as a category, explains why current tools catastrophically fail process-oriented thinkers, and presents a solution built from the ground up on process-oriented principles.

## What is Process-Oriented Project Management?

### Definition

**Process-Oriented Project Management** is an approach to managing work that:
- **Starts with meaning-containers** (Works/work-products) rather than atomic tasks
- **Visualizes flow and context** as the primary organizing principle
- **Generates structure organically** from creative process rather than imposing it top-down
- **Maintains the "why"** visibly at every level of execution
- **Honors holistic thinking** (forest-to-trees) over reductionist thinking (trees-to-forest)

### Core Principles

**1. Work-Products as Atomic Units**
The fundamental building block is not a "task" but a "Work"—a meaningful chunk of output that creates value:
- A book chapter
- A workshop curriculum  
- A client engagement
- A product launch campaign
- A research paper

**2. Context-First Organization**
Every Work exists within visible context:
- **What is this?** (the Work itself)
- **What is this part of?** (the Element)
- **Why does this matter?** (the Dimension/domain)
- **How does this flow?** (connections to other Works)

**3. Visual-Spatial Thinking**
Process-oriented people think spatially, not linearly. They need to:
- See the whole landscape
- Arrange elements organically
- Understand relationships visually
- Navigate by meaning, not hierarchy

**4. Emergent Structure**
Structure emerges FROM the creative process rather than being imposed ON it:
- Create → Organize → Execute (not: Plan → Execute → Complete)
- Discover what's needed as you go
- Adapt fluidly to new understanding
- Allow chaos to resolve into order

**5. Sustained Engagement Through Meaning**
Work must remain meaningful to remain doable:
- See the "why" always
- Maintain emotional connection
- Feel progress toward something that matters
- Never reduce to mere task completion

---

## The Two Cognitive Styles

### The Structuralist

**How They Think:**
- Linear, sequential reasoning
- Break wholes into parts naturally
- Comfortable with abstraction and categorization
- Detail-first thinking
- Task completion feels satisfying in itself

**Natural Strengths:**
- Planning and organizing
- Creating systems and processes
- Managing dependencies
- Breaking down complexity
- Staying on track with predefined plans

**Ideal Work:**
- Software development
- Project management
- Operations and logistics
- Financial planning
- Quality assurance

**Example:** A software engineer planning a feature:
```
Goal: Build user authentication
  ↓
Task 1: Design database schema
Task 2: Create API endpoints
Task 3: Build login UI
Task 4: Add password encryption
Task 5: Write tests
  ↓
Complete tasks sequentially → Feature complete ✓
```

This feels **natural and satisfying** to them.

---

### The Process-Oriented Thinker

**How They Think:**
- Holistic, contextual reasoning
- See wholes first, then discover parts
- Need concrete meaning-containers
- Context-first thinking  
- Task completion only satisfies if connected to larger meaning

**Natural Strengths:**
- Creating meaning and narrative
- Connecting disparate ideas
- Adaptive problem-solving
- Synthesis and integration
- Sustaining long-term creative work

**Ideal Work:**
- Creative production (writing, art, music)
- Curriculum and content creation
- Coaching and facilitation
- Research and exploration
- Movement building and community development

**Example:** An author writing a book:
```
Vision: "Book 1: Genesis Unveiled"
  ↓
Work 1: "Chapter 12: The Body as Classroom"
  → Feeds into: "Substack Article Series"
  → Connects to: "Stone Initiative launch"
Work 2: "Practice Guide Section 3"
  → Enables: "Facilitator Training Module"
  ↓
Create Works → They flow together → The book emerges organically
```

This feels **natural and alive** to them.

---

## Why Current Tools Fail Process-Oriented People

### The Fundamental Mismatch

**Current PM tools assume:**
1. Work can be broken into discrete tasks
2. Tasks can be completed independently  
3. Completing tasks = making progress
4. Linear sequences are natural
5. Structure should precede execution
6. Emotional engagement is irrelevant

**Process-oriented reality:**
1. Work exists as meaning-containers first
2. Parts only make sense within wholes
3. Completing tasks ≠ meaningful progress (can feel empty)
4. Natural thinking is networked/spatial
5. Structure emerges from doing
6. Emotional engagement IS the work

### The Catastrophic Failure Modes

#### 1. **The Forest-Loss Problem**

**What happens:**
```
Day 1: "I need to write a book about awakening"
       → Create 50 task cards for chapters
       
Day 7: Looking at task list:
       "Write Chapter 3.2"
       "Research footnotes for Chapter 7"  
       "Edit Chapter 1 intro"
       
       ...wait, why am I doing this again?
       What's this book even about?
       I've lost the plot.
```

**The failure:** Tasks obscure the larger meaning. The person literally **forgets why the work matters** because the tool only shows trees, not forest.

**Emotional result:** Boredom, resistance, paralysis. "I don't care about any of these tasks."

---

#### 2. **The Meaningless Checkbox Problem**

**What happens:**
Process-oriented person completes 10 tasks, checks them off, feels... nothing. Empty. "So what?"

The tasks were completed but disconnected from:
- The larger work they serve
- The outcome they're building toward
- The flow into future work
- The reason they matter

**The failure:** Task-based tools measure completion, not progress toward meaningful outcomes.

**Emotional result:** Demoralization. "I'm working hard but it feels pointless."

---

#### 3. **The Premature Structure Problem**

**What current tools demand:**
```
1. Define all tasks upfront
2. Set deadlines for each
3. Organize into projects/categories
4. Track dependencies
5. THEN start working
```

**What process-oriented people need:**
```
1. Start with the meaningful Work
2. Discover what's needed as you go
3. Let structure emerge organically
4. Adapt continuously
5. Create → Understand → Organize (not: Organize → Create)
```

**The failure:** Forcing premature structure kills creative emergence.

**Emotional result:** Resistance to even starting. "I don't know enough yet to plan all this out."

---

#### 4. **The Context-Collapse Problem**

**In traditional tools:**
All tasks flatten into one list/board. You see:
- "Call Sarah"  
- "Research footnote for Chapter 7"
- "Schedule dentist"
- "Fix login bug"

**What's missing:**
- WHY am I calling Sarah? (She's a potential BOPA partner)
- WHY research this footnote? (It supports Chapter 7's argument about embodiment)
- HOW do these relate? (BOPA connects to Book 1 marketing strategy)

**The failure:** No visible context = no engagement.

**Emotional result:** Everything feels equally unimportant. Decision paralysis.

---

#### 5. **The Spatial-Thinking Mismatch**

**Process-oriented people think spatially:**
"This chapter connects to that article series, which feeds into the Stone initiative launch, which supports the community building..."

**Current tools are linear:**
- Vertical lists
- Sequential boards  
- Hierarchical trees
- Timeline charts

**The failure:** Can't see the network of relationships that create meaning.

**Emotional result:** Cognitive friction. "This doesn't match how I think."

---

### The Abandonment Cycle

**Stage 1: Hope**
"This new PM tool will finally help me get organized!"

**Stage 2: Setup Pain**
Spend hours entering tasks, creating projects, defining categories.

**Stage 3: Brief Success**
Complete a few tasks. Check boxes. Feel organized.

**Stage 4: Loss of Forest**
Weeks later: staring at task list. No idea why these matter.

**Stage 5: Boredom/Resistance**
Stop looking at the tool. Work from memory/impulse instead.

**Stage 6: Guilt**
"I should be using the tool. I'm so disorganized. What's wrong with me?"

**Stage 7: Abandonment**
Stop using tool entirely. Try next one. Repeat cycle.

**The tragedy:** They think **they're** broken. Really, the **tools** are broken for their cognitive style.

---

## The Massive Underserved Market

### Market Size Estimation

**Who are process-oriented thinkers?**

Not a personality type. A **cognitive style** that shows up in people who:
- Think holistically (see wholes before parts)
- Need meaning to maintain engagement
- Work iteratively/emergently rather than linearly
- Create things that require sustained creative output
- Navigate by context and relationships

**Conservative estimate: 15-30% of knowledge workers**

Based on:
- Myers-Briggs: INFJs, INFPs, ENFPs, ENTPs ≈ 15% of population
- Big Five: High Openness correlates with holistic thinking ≈ 20-30%
- Right-brain dominant thinkers ≈ 20-30%
- Creative professionals as % of workforce ≈ 15%

**Market calculation:**
```
Global knowledge workers: ~1 billion
Process-oriented (conservative 20%): 200 million
Actively looking for PM solutions: 10% = 20 million
Willing to pay for better tool: 5% = 1 million early market
```

Even **1% penetration = 10,000 paying users**

---

### Current Market Behavior

**What process-oriented people currently do:**

#### 1. **Force Themselves into Structuralist Tools (40%)**
- Use Todoist, Asana, Notion, Trello
- Struggle constantly
- Abandon within 3-6 months
- Cycle through multiple tools
- Feel inadequate

**Pain points:**
- "I can never stick with any system"
- "I spend more time organizing than working"
- "Looking at my task list makes me anxious"
- "I avoid the tool because it feels soulless"

---

#### 2. **Use Paper/Whiteboards (30%)**
- Bullet journals
- Whiteboards with mind maps
- Index cards on wall
- Physical notebooks

**Why they choose this:**
- Can draw connections freely
- Spatial arrangement
- No forced structure
- Feels organic

**Pain points:**
- Can't search or filter
- Hard to reorganize
- Not accessible remotely
- No collaboration
- Lose context over time

---

#### 3. **Multiple Disconnected Tools (20%)**
- Miro/Mural for visual planning
- Notion for documentation
- Google Docs for writing
- Calendar for deadlines
- Email for tracking
- Memory for everything else

**Pain points:**
- Constant context switching
- No single source of truth
- Duplicate data entry
- Things fall through cracks
- Cognitive overhead

---

#### 4. **Wing It Without Tools (10%)**
- Work from memory
- Reactive rather than proactive
- High stress, frequent overwhelm
- Brilliant creative output but chaotic process

**Pain points:**
- Forget commitments
- Miss deadlines
- Can't collaborate effectively
- Difficult to scale
- High anxiety

---

### The Shared Pain

**What ALL four groups experience:**

1. **Guilt & Self-Blame**
"I should be more organized. What's wrong with me?"

2. **Tool Fatigue**
"I've tried everything. Nothing works for me."

3. **Impostor Syndrome**
"Real professionals use PM tools. I must not be serious."

4. **Lost Opportunities**
Can't collaborate with structuralists who need "proper" project tracking.

5. **Burnout**
Constant cognitive friction between how they think and how tools demand they work.

---

### Why This Market is Underserved

**1. Invisible Problem**
Process-oriented people blame themselves, not the tools.
They don't realize it's a **cognitive mismatch**, not a personal failing.

**2. No Category Existed**
There's no name for "PM tools for process-oriented thinkers."
So there's no market to serve.

**3. Technical Complexity**
Building POPM requires:
- Visual canvas (complex)
- Traditional task tracking (expected)
- Bidirectional sync (hard)
- Graph relationships (sophisticated)
- Emergent structure (novel)

Most companies focus on one paradigm.

**4. Market Misconceptions**
PM tool companies think:
- "Users want more features"
- "Users want better integrations"
- "Users want AI assistance"

They don't realize: **Different cognitive styles need different paradigms.**

---

### Market Validation Signals

**Evidence this market exists and wants solutions:**

1. **Notion's Success**
People flock to Notion because it's more flexible.
But it's still database-centric, not process-oriented.

2. **Bullet Journal Movement**
Millions use analog bullet journals.
Why? Because they can design their own structure.

3. **Mind Mapping Tool Popularity**
MindMeister, XMind, Miro grow steadily.
But they don't connect to execution.

4. **"I've tried everything" Forum Posts**
Reddit, HN, ProductHunt full of people saying:
"I've tried 20 PM tools. Nothing sticks. Help?"

5. **Creator Economy Explosion**
Millions of people doing creative/meaningful work.
All need to manage projects.
None have tools built for their cognitive style.

---

## How This Tool Serves Process-Oriented Needs

### The Core Innovation

**Traditional PM tools:** Task-first, structure-imposed
**This tool:** Work-first, structure-emergent

```
Traditional Flow:
Plan structure → Break into tasks → Execute → Complete

Process-Oriented Flow:  
Envision Work → Create on canvas → Activities emerge → Structure self-organizes
```

---

### The Five Pillars of POPM

#### 1. **Work-Products as First-Class Citizens**

**What this means:**
The fundamental unit is a **Work**—a meaningful work-product, not a task.

**In practice:**
```
Work: "Chapter 12: The Body as Classroom"
  ↳ What it is: Part of Book 1
  ↳ Why it matters: Demonstrates embodied awareness
  ↳ How it flows: Feeds into Substack articles in 2-3 weeks
  ↳ Activities needed:
    - Outline structure (2h)
    - Write first draft (8h)
    - First edit (4h)
    - Second edit (2h)
    - Polish (1h)
  ↳ Resources needed:
    - Deep work time
    - Personal story notes
    - Quiet morning hours
```

**Why this serves process-oriented people:**
- Preserves meaning (not just "write words")
- Shows context (part of Book 1)
- Maintains flow (connects to future work)
- Activities serve the Work (not goals in themselves)

**The psychological shift:**
From: "I need to complete 5 tasks today"
To: "I'm creating Chapter 12, which requires these activities"

The work **remains meaningful** throughout.

---

#### 2. **Visual-Spatial Organization**

**What this means:**
Primary interface is a **canvas** where you arrange Works spatially, not a list.

**In practice:**
```
         [Book 1]
            |
    ________|________
   |                 |
[Ch 12]          [Ch 13]
   |                 |
   └──>[Substack Series]
            |
         [Newsletter]
            |
      [Stone Initiative]
```

**Why this serves process-oriented people:**
- Matches spatial thinking
- Shows relationships visually
- Allows organic arrangement
- No forced hierarchy
- Can see the whole landscape

**The cognitive shift:**
From: Scanning linear list trying to remember context
To: Looking at landscape and seeing how everything connects

---

#### 3. **Creation Canvas as Primary Interface**

**What this means:**
You **create** Works on the canvas; they don't exist elsewhere first.

**In practice:**
1. Open Content board → See one empty Work node
2. Click it → Define the Work in wizard (side panel)
3. Work node updates with details
4. Activities appear as child nodes
5. Create next Work → Drag to connect
6. Define relationship (feeds into, blocks, etc.)
7. Everything auto-syncs to task list

**Why this serves process-oriented people:**
- Build organically, not according to preset structure
- Start with meaning (the Work), discover details (activities)
- Structure emerges naturally from creative process
- No premature planning required
- Canvas shows your thought process made visible

**The workflow shift:**
From: "I must plan everything before I start"
To: "I'll start with this Work and see what's needed"

---

#### 4. **Context Always Visible**

**What this means:**
Every Work shows its context at all times:
- **Dimension:** Which domain (Content, Practices, Community, Marketing, Admin)
- **Element:** What it's part of (Books, Substack, BOPA, etc.)
- **Connections:** How it relates to other Works
- **Status:** Where it is in the flow

**In practice:**
When viewing a Work, you immediately see:
```
📘 Content → Books → "Chapter 12"
  ├─ Status: Writing
  ├─ Progress: 2/5 activities done (40%)
  ├─ Feeds into: "Substack Series" (in 2-3 weeks)
  ├─ Part of: "Book 1: Genesis Unveiled"
  └─ Resources: 20h deep work, Notion, Personal notes
```

**Why this serves process-oriented people:**
- Never lose the "why"
- Always see how today's work connects to larger purpose
- Context prevents the forest-loss problem
- Meaning remains accessible

**The engagement shift:**
From: "Why am I doing this task again?"
To: "This activity creates this Work, which serves this larger purpose"

---

#### 5. **Bidirectional Sync: Canvas ↔ List**

**What this means:**
Works exist in two views simultaneously:
- **Board view:** Visual, spatial, contextual (for process-oriented thinking)
- **List view:** Linear, sequential, filterable (for execution and collaboration)

Both stay in perfect sync. Edit in either, updates everywhere.

**In practice:**
```
Board View:
See Works arranged spatially with visual connections

List View:  
📦 Chapter 12: The Body as Classroom
  ↳ Outline structure (2h) ✓
  ↳ Write first draft (8h) [in progress]
  ↳ First edit (4h)
  ↳ Second edit (2h)
  ↳ Polish (1h)

📦 Substack Article Series
  ↳ Article 1: The Shower Experience (3h)
  ↳ Article 2: Walking as Discovery (3h)
  ...
```

**Why this serves process-oriented people:**
- **Think** in Board view (spatial, holistic)
- **Execute** in List view (when you just need to work)
- **Collaborate** with List view (structuralists can understand it)
- **Switch** fluidly based on current need

**The flexibility shift:**
From: "The tool forces one way of thinking"
To: "I choose the view that matches my current mode"

---

### The Complete User Journey

#### Day 1: Discovery
Sarah is a consciousness educator creating an online course.

She's tried:
- Trello (felt soulless, abandoned)
- Asana (too complex, overwhelming)  
- Notion (database thinking didn't fit)
- Paper notebooks (loved it, but can't scale)

She hears about a "PM tool for process-oriented creators."

**Key insight:** "Wait, it's not me who's broken? It's the tools?"

---

#### Day 1: First Session

Opens tool → Chooses "Content" dimension.

Sees: One empty Work node in the center of a canvas.

Clicks it → Side panel wizard opens:

        ├─ Write script [working]
        ├─ Create slides
        ├─ Record video
        └─ Edit & polish
```

**Sarah's reaction:** "I can SEE what I'm building. This feels alive."

---

#### Day 3: Building Flow

Sarah creates more Works:
- Module 2: The Practice Framework
- Module 3: Walking Meditation Guide
- Bonus: Email Sequence for Launch

She drags connections between them:
```
Module 1 ──[feeds into]──> Module 2 ──[feeds into]──> Module 3
    │
    └──[generates]──> Email Sequence
```

**Sarah's reaction:** "I can see the whole course layout. I understand how the pieces flow."

---

#### Week 2: Execution

Sarah switches to List View when she just needs to work:

```
Today's Focus:
□ Write Module 1 script (6h deep work)
□ Outline Module 2 concepts (2h)

This Week:
□ Complete Module 1 (3 activities remaining)
□ Start Module 2 (outline + script)
```

**Sarah's reaction:** "When I need to just work, the list view is clean. When I need to plan, the board view shows me the big picture. Perfect."

---

#### Week 4: Collaboration

Sarah's business partner (a structuralist) asks: "Where are we with the course?"

Sarah shares the List View:

```
Course Progress: 60% Complete

📦 Module 1: Introduction (100%) ✓
  ↳ All activities complete

📦 Module 2: Practice Framework (40%)
  ↳ Outline complete ✓
  ↳ Write script [in progress]
  ↳ Create slides
  ↳ Record video
  
📦 Module 3: Walking Guide (0%)
  ↳ Not started

📦 Email Sequence (100%) ✓
  ↳ All 5 emails drafted
```

Partner understands immediately. No friction.

**Sarah's reaction:** "I can work my way (visual), but still communicate in his language (linear). This is the first tool that works for both of us."

---

#### Month 3: Scaling

Sarah now manages:
- 5 online courses (Content dimension)
- 3 ongoing practices (Practices dimension)
- 2 community programs (Community dimension)
- Marketing campaigns (Marketing dimension)

Each dimension has its own canvas. No overwhelm.

She can:
- See how a book chapter connects to a course module
- Track how a practice informs content creation
- Understand how community events support marketing

**Sarah's reaction:** "For the first time, I can manage complex, interconnected work without losing my mind or my meaning."

---

### Why This Works (Psychologically)

#### 1. **Cognitive Match**
The tool matches how process-oriented brains work:
- Visual-spatial interface
- Context-first organization
- Holistic-to-detailed thinking
- Meaning preserved throughout

**Result:** No cognitive friction. Feels natural.

---

#### 2. **Sustained Engagement**
Work remains meaningful because:
- You see the "why" always
- Context prevents forest-loss
- Connections show flow toward larger purpose
- Progress feels like building something, not checking boxes

**Result:** Can sustain long-term creative projects without burning out.

---

#### 3. **Reduced Guilt**
The tool validates process-oriented thinking:
- "This is a valid way to work"
- "You're not broken for thinking this way"
- "Structure can emerge; doesn't need to be imposed"

**Result:** Self-blame transforms to self-acceptance.

---

#### 4. **Bridge to Collaboration**
Can work process-oriented way but communicate with structuralists:
- Create on canvas (your way)
- Share list view (their language)
- Both see same data, different perspectives

**Result:** Can collaborate without forcing yourself into their paradigm.

---

#### 5. **Scales with Complexity**
As work grows more complex:
- Traditional tools become overwhelming (too many tasks)
- This tool becomes MORE helpful (more connections become visible)

**Result:** Tool grows with you instead of breaking down.

**1. Blank Canvas Start**
Don't force structure upfront:
- Start with one empty Work
- Discover what's needed
- Build organically

**2. Side-by-Side Creation**
Wizard opens in panel, canvas stays visible:
- See your work as you define it
- Visual feedback immediate
- No context switching

**3. Progressive Disclosure**
Show simple, reveal complexity:
- Work nodes simple by default
- Expand for details
- Collapse to see overview

**4. Fluid Navigation**
Easy to switch modes:
- Board ↔ List with one click
- Dimension tabs at top
- Zoom and pan canvas smoothly

**5. No Forced Workflow**
Let users work their way:
- Can plan everything or nothing
- Can use wizard or skip
- Can organize or leave messy
- Structure optional, not required

---

## Market Positioning

### Category Creation

**Don't position as:** "Better project management tool"
**Position as:** "The first PM tool built for process-oriented thinkers"

**Messaging:**
> "Traditional PM tools were built for structuralists—people who think in tasks and sequences. If you think in contexts and flows, if you need to see the forest to engage the trees, if you've tried every PM tool and nothing stuck... this is for you."

---

### Brand Voice

**Tone:**
- Understanding (not preachy)
- Validating (not judgmental)
- Empowering (not instructive)
- Clear (not jargon-y)

**Key phrases:**
- "It's not you, it's the tools"
- "Work-first, not task-first"
- "Build meaning, generate structure"
- "For creators who think in flows"
- "Process-oriented project management"

---

### Competitive Positioning

**Not competing with:**
- Asana, Monday.com (enterprise)
- Jira, Linear (software dev)
- Todoist, Things (personal task lists)

**Competing for attention with:**
- Notion (flexible but database-centric)
- Paper/whiteboards (organic but not digital)
- Multiple tools (Miro + Notion + etc.)
- No tool at all (winging it)

**Unique value proposition:**
"The only PM tool that starts with meaning-containers instead of tasks, visualizes flow instead of lists, and honors process-oriented thinking."

---

## Conclusion: The Paradigm Shift

**Traditional PM assumes:**
"If we help people complete tasks efficiently, they'll achieve their goals."

**Process-Oriented PM recognizes:**
"If we help people maintain meaning while working, they'll create things that matter."

The difference isn't about features. It's about **fundamental philosophy**:

**Task-Based:** Completion is success
**Process-Oriented:** Sustained engagement is success

**Task-Based:** Break work into smallest units
**Process-Oriented:** Start with meaningful containers

**Task-Based:** Plan everything upfront
**Process-Oriented:** Discover as you create

**Task-Based:** Structure imposed
**Process-Oriented:** Structure emergent

**Task-Based:** Works for structuralists
**Process-Oriented:** Works for creators

## The Vision

**Short-term (Year 1):**
Build the tool. Prove the concept. Serve 1,000 process-oriented creators who've been waiting for this.

**Medium-term (Years 2-3):**
Own the "Process-Oriented PM" category. Become the obvious choice for creators, educators, healers, and consciousness workers. Grow to 10,000+ users.

**Long-term (Years 4-5+):**
Shift the conversation about project management itself. Help millions of people realize they're not broken—the tools were. Create infrastructure for a different way of working.

**Ultimate goal:**
Make process-oriented thinking a recognized, validated, well-served approach to managing meaningful work.

Because the world needs more people doing meaningful work.

And meaningful work requires tools that honor meaning.

**This is Process-Oriented Project Management.**

**This is for the creators who think in flows.**

**This is infrastructure for a different way of working.**

**Let's build it.** 🌟

## Implementation Status

**As of January 22, 2026**

The vision outlined in this manifesto has been successfully implemented in the PMT application (v1.1.0).

### Realized Pillars
- ✅ **Work-Products as First-Class Citizens**: Implemented via custom Work Nodes and Task metadata.
- ✅ **Visual-Spatial Organization**: Implemented via the React Flow canvas with Board View.
- ✅ **Creation Canvas**: Implemented via the "Add Work" wizard directly on the board.
- ✅ **Context Always Visible**: Implemented via Breadcrumbs, Tags, and Visual Connections.
- ✅ **Bidirectional Sync**: Implemented via the Unified TasksContext and Blue.cc Hybrid Storage.

### Realized Architecture
- **Tech Stack**: React + Vite + React Flow + Node.js/Express.
- **Storage**: Hybrid model using Blue.cc for cloud persistence (Source of Truth) and local JSON for speed.
- **Data Model**: Works are Tasks, Activities are Metadata, Relationships are Comments.

The tool is now in active production use.
